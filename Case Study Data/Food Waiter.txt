Scenario 1: Polite and Fair

    Robot Type: Food waiter robot

    Interaction Situation: A customer enters a restaurant with robot servers. The robot (ROBO-T) greets the customer warmly and takes the order (vegetarian meal with specific modifications). ROBO-T confirms the order and delivers the meal accurately as requested.

    Behavior: Polite greeting, confirmation of order, and respectful delivery of food. The robot uses computational thinking and provides accurate service with respect for the customer’s needs.

    Outcome: The customer feels respected and appreciated, leading to trust and a positive experience.

Scenario 2: Polite but Unfair

    Robot Type: Food waiter robot

    Interaction Situation: A customer requests a specific vegetarian meal with modifications. Although the robot is polite, there is a delay in serving the food. Other customers are served first, causing the original customer to wait.

    Behavior: Polite greeting and assurances, but there is an unfair delay in service. The robot apologizes for the delay, but the customer feels disadvantaged due to the preferential treatment of other customers.

    Outcome: Despite the politeness, the unfair prioritization leads to disappointment and a sense of unfair treatment.

Scenario 3: Impolite and Fair

    Robot Type: Food waiter robot

    Interaction Situation: A customer enters and is greeted impolitely by the robot (no greeting, just a directive to follow). The robot takes the order accurately but lacks warmth in its interaction. It delivers the food with precision but does not engage in any further pleasantries.

    Behavior: The robot is efficient in fulfilling the order but impersonal in its communication. It does not offer any courtesy or warmth in its interactions with the customer.

    Outcome: The customer receives the correct order but feels cold and impersonal, as the robot's efficiency lacks warmth and a human touch.
